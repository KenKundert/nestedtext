***********************
The Zen of *NestedText*
***********************

*NestedText* aspires to be a simple dumb vessel that holds peoples' structured 
data, and does so in a way that allows people to easily interact with that 
data.

The desire to be simple is an attempt to minimize the effort required to learn 
and use the language. Ideally people can understand it by looking at one or two 
examples and they can use it without without needing to remember any arcane 
rules and without relying on any of the knowledge that programmers accumulate 
through years of experience.  One source of simplicity is consistency.  As such, 
*NestedText* uses a small number of rules that it applies with few exceptions.

The desire to be dumb means that *NestedText* tries not to transform the data 
in any meaningful way.  It parses the structure of the data without doing 
anything that might change how the data is interpreted.  Instead, it aims to 
make it easy for you to interpret the data yourself.  After all, you understand 
what the data is supposed to mean, so you are in the best position to interpret 
it.  There are also many powerful tools available to help with :doc:`this exact 
task <schemas>`.

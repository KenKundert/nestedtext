*NestedText* is a file format for holding structured data that is to be entered, 
edited, or viewed by people.  It allows data to be organized into a nested 
collection of dictionaries, lists, and strings without the need for quoting or 
escaping.  In this way it is similar to *JSON*, *YAML* and *TOML*, but without 
the complexity and risk of *YAML* and without the syntactic clutter of *JSON* 
and *TOML*.  *NestedText* is both simple and natural.  Only a small number of 
concepts and rules must be kept in mind when creating it.  It is easily created, 
modified, or viewed with a text editor and easily understood and used by both 
programmers and non-programmers.

*NestedText* is convenient for configuration files, address books, account 
information and the like.  Here is an example of a file that contains a few 
addresses:

.. code-block:: nestedtext

    # Contact information for our officers

    president:
        name: Katheryn McDaniel
        address:

The format holds dictionaries (ordered collections of name/value pairs), lists 
(ordered collections of values) and strings (text) organized hierarchically to 
any depth.  Indentation is used to indicate the hierarchy of the data, and 
a simple natural syntax is used to distinguish the types of data in such 
a manner that needs no quoting or escaping.  Specifically, lines that begin with 
a word (or words) followed by a colon are dictionary items, lines that begin 
with a dash are list items, lines that begin with a greater-than sign are part 
of a multiline string, and lines that begin with a hash are comments and are 
ignored.  Dictionaries and lists can be nested arbitrarily.

*NestedText* is somewhat unique in that the leaf values are always strings. Of 
course the values start off as strings in the input file, but alternatives like 
*YAML* or *TOML* aggressively convert those values into the underlying data 
types such as integers, floats, and Booleans.  For example, a value like 2.10 
would be converted to a floating point number. But making the decision to do so 
based purely on the form of the value, not the context in which it is found, can 
lead to misinterpretations.  For example, assume that this value is the software 
version number two point ten. By converting it to a floating point number it 
becomes two point one, which is wrong. There are many possible versions of this 
basic issue. But there is also the inverse problem; values that should be 
converted to particular data types but are not recognized.  For example, a value 
of $2.00 should be converted to a real number but would remain a string instead.  
There are simply too many values types for a general purpose solution that is 
only looking at the values themselves to be able to interpret all of them.  For 
example, 12/10/09 is likely a date, but is it in MM/DD/YY, YY/MM/DD or DD/MM/YY 
form?  The fact is, the value alone is often insufficient to reliably determine 
how to convert values into internal data types.  *NestedText* avoids these 
problems by leaving the values in their original form and allowing the decision 
to be made by the end application where more context is available to help guide 
the conversions.  If a price is expected for a value, then $2.00 would be 
checked and converted accordingly. Similarly, local conventions along with the 
fact that a date is expected for a particular value allows 12/10/09 to be 
correctly validated and converted.  This process of validation and conversion is 
referred to as applying a schema to the data.  There are packages such as 
`Pydantic <https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io>`_ and `Voluptuous 
<https://github.com/alecthomas/voluptuous>`_ available that make this process 
easy and reliable.

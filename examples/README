Run unpack to decrypt and unpack your archive using::

    ./unpack <yourname>-<date>.tgz.gpg

It will create a directory <yourname>-<date> that contains your information.
This directory contains sensitive information, so keep it secure.  
I recommend that you just copy out the information you need, then delete it.
